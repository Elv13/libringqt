# This isn't pretty, and the blame is on me. I was clueless when I first

# project name in `ring-lrc/CMakeLists.txt`. This causes problems when the
# ring-lrc Git repository is used in CMake external projects. Given
# changing it above would break the API, it instead add a second target
# with the proper name.
